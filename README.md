    As a movie enthusiast, I understand the frustration of having to search for trailers

    We take appropriate measures to safeguard user data, and we do not share your data with

    In terms of technology, our website has a landing page and four sub-pages, where 
    one of them being the Contact page, which has a form with input validation, all linked via React-Routing. It is a component-based project architecture built using an API and
